Old_Code

If Class Directory has too many files, I will compress them in order for them to fit

Note: The code I upload here might not be the final versions, or complete. This is old code I still had on the now gone CSIF computers before they wiped them, and so theres are not the best representations of what I have accomplished in class.
Also These files might be incomplete, and were put together before I had a good understanding of the use and benefits of git. So there is no version data (for the most part) or good code.

Take from this what you want. Unless if you want to use this code for classes. if you land on this page and you're a student, do the projects yourself and learn, that will hep you out in the long run. Also this code would most likely hinder you, since I wasn't always a good programmer and learned a lot throughout my time in college.
