Notes:
1) The "###..." isn't official Bibtex comment syntax :)
2) When specificying a title, wrap it in {} braces, or
else Bibtex will lowercase every word after the first
3) The howpublished field is needed in order to have the
URLs be shown in the citations at the end
4) Use \cite{} for in-text citations
